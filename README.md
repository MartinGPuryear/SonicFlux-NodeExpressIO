SonicFlux-NodeExpressIO
Martin G. Puryear
=======================

  SonicFlux is a music-oriented quiz app, using Ruby on Rails3, NodeJS and ExpressIO, 
JavaScript, SVG, Bootstrap3 and SQLite.  

  The SonicFlux project is more interesting and complex than other posted projects to 
date, as it was created over the course of weeks, as opposed to days or hours.

  This repository is referred to as 'SonicNode', because it is the Node.js server.
It handles all code related to timers and round durations, rooms and leaderboards.
